Space Invadorz
==============

A simple little game that I'm gradually complicating, and using as excuse
to learn web APIs I've never had a reason to try. Adapted from
[Mary Rose Cook](http://github.com/maryrosecook)'s code from her
[excellent, excellent live-coding demo](https://vimeo.com/105955605).

[Playable here](http://evanstoner.com/space-invadorz/).

To run it yourself:
```
npm install
npm start
```
And point your browser to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).
